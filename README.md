This README.md is too short. Having more details will help people assess your
package quickly and fairly.

When people look at your README, they are wondering:

  - What does this package even do?
  - Will it help me solve MY problems?

So I recommend starting your README with a small example of the most common
usage scenario. Show people what they can expect if they learn more!

Note: By publishing your package, you are inviting people to invest time in
understanding your work. Spending an hour to communicate your knowledge more
clearly can save the community days or weeks of time in aggregate, and saving
time in aggregate is the whole point of publishing packages! People really
appreciate it, and it makes the whole ecosystem feel nicer!
